# Crate References Guide

This workspace maintains a dedicated folder for documenting unfamiliar Rust crates at [docs/references/index.md](mdc:docs/references/index.md).

## Available Crate References

The following crates have detailed documentation:

- [RMCP (Rust Model Context Protocol)](mdc:docs/references/rmcp.md) - Clean Rust implementation of the Model Context Protocol

## Adding New Crates

When encountering an unfamiliar crate:

1. Create a new markdown file in the `docs/references/` folder using the crate name
2. Update the index at [docs/references/index.md](mdc:docs/references/index.md)
3. Follow the structured format used in existing reference documents

## Fixing Documentation

When noticing inaccuracies or needing to update information:

1. Open the specific reference document
2. Update the information
3. Note the changes in a comment at the end of the file in a "Revision History" section
